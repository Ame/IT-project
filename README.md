# IT-project

This is the repository for our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application. It was built by iJane, students at the University of Melbourne for our capstone project.
It is intended for users to manage their clients, with the functionality to add contacts along with their contact information, edit and delete them and categorise them. It was built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

The application is currently deployed at: https://ijane.herokuapp.com/

## How to set up this project

In order to continue working on this project, you should clone the repository to your local machine.

To start the project you should clone the repository and run `npm install` in a terminal that has navigated to the project folder in order to install the dependencies for the backend. To install dependencies for the front end, you should navigate to the 'client' folder within a terminal, and then also run `npm install`.

To start the project locally, within the main project folder in a terminal, run `npm start` to start the backend and connect to the database. Leave that running and open another terminal, navigate to the 'client' folder, and run `npm start` to start the front end. After starting the front end, you may get a prompt to run the front end on a different port number. After this is done, the localhost should open up in your browser with the local version of the site.
